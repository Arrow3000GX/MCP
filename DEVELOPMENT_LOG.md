# Development Log

This log tracks major changes, fixes, and improvements made to the WRO project.

## 2024-12-19 - UK Trains MCP Server Setup & ES Module Fixes

### Changes Made:

#### 1. UK Trains MCP Server Development
- **What**: Created a comprehensive UK Trains MCP server with multiple tools
- **Why**: User requested MCP server for UK train information including National Rail and TfL data
- **Files Created**:
  - `uk-trains-server.js` - Initial ES6 module version
  - `uk-trains-server-simple.js` - CommonJS version (failed due to ES module config)
  - `uk-trains-working.js` - CommonJS version (failed due to ES module config)
  - `uk-trains-esm.js` - Final working ES module version
- **Tools Implemented**:
  - `get_train_departures` - Get real-time train departure information
  - `get_tfl_status` - Get Transport for London service status
  - `search_stations` - Search for UK train stations by name

#### 2. ES Module Compatibility Fix
- **What**: Fixed ES module compatibility issues with MCP server
- **Why**: Project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json, requiring ES6 imports instead of CommonJS requires
- **Problem**: `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope`
- **Solution**: Converted all `require()` statements to `import` statements
- **Files Modified**: Created new ES module version `uk-trains-esm.js`

#### 3. uvx PATH Fix for Fetch Server
- **What**: Installed and configured `uvx` (Python package runner) for fetch server
- **Why**: Fetch server was failing with `Error: spawn uvx ENOENT`
- **Solution**: 
  - Installed uvx using official installer: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Added `~/.local/bin` to PATH in `~/.zshrc`
  - Verified installation with `which uvx`

#### 4. MCP Server Configuration Files
- **What**: Created multiple configuration files for different upload methods
- **Why**: xiaozhi-mcphub supports both manual server addition and DXT file uploads
- **Files Created**:
  - `uk-trains-mcp-config.json` - Basic configuration
  - `uk-trains-mcp-server.json` - Comprehensive configuration with examples
  - `uk-trains-mcp-configuration.json` - DXT upload format
  - `uk-trains-mcp.dxt` - DXT file (attempted ZIP and JSON formats)
  - `setup-uk-trains-mcp.sh` - Setup script for dependencies

#### 5. GitHub Integration & Cursor Rules
- **What**: Set up automatic GitHub uploads and created cursor rules
- **Why**: User requested automatic backup of all changes to GitHub
- **Files Created**:
  - `.cursorrules` - Defines automatic Git workflow
- **Workflow**: Auto-commit and push all changes on every run

### Current Status:
- ✅ UK Trains MCP server working with ES modules
- ✅ uvx installed and PATH configured
- ✅ Ready for testing in xiaozhi-mcphub interface

### Next Steps:
- Test UK Trains MCP server connection in xiaozhi-mcphub
- Verify all tools work correctly
- Document successful configuration for future reference

### Technical Notes:
- Project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- MCP SDK version: 1.20.1
- Node.js version: v22.14.0
- uvx provides Python package execution capabilities
