# Cursor Rules for WRO Project
# Auto-GitHub Upload Configuration

## Automatic GitHub Upload Rule
**CRITICAL**: For every code change, modification, or run, you MUST automatically upload changes to GitHub using the following workflow:

1. **Always check git status first**: `git status`
2. **Stage all changes**: `git add .`
3. **Commit with descriptive message**: `git commit -m "Auto-commit: [describe the change]"`
4. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main`

## Required Workflow for Every Session
Before completing any task or making any changes:

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with timestamp and description
git commit -m "Auto-commit $(date): [brief description of changes]"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Commit Message Guidelines
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Include timestamp when possible
- Describe what was changed or added
- Examples:
  - "Auto-commit: Updated ESP32 configuration"
  - "Auto-commit: Added new board support"
  - "Auto-commit: Fixed audio codec issues"
  - "Auto-commit: Updated documentation"

## Error Handling
If push fails:
1. Check authentication: `git remote -v`
2. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
3. Resolve conflicts if any
4. Retry push: `git push origin main`

## Project Context
- Repository: https://github.com/ybro2011/WRO.git
- Main branch: main
- Project: xiaozhi-esp32 ESP32 firmware project
- Auto-upload is MANDATORY for all changes

## Additional Rules
- Never leave changes uncommitted
- Always verify upload success
- Maintain clean git history
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Test changes before committing when possible

**REMINDER**: This rule applies to ALL interactions - every code change, file modification, or project update MUST be automatically uploaded to GitHub before completing the task.
