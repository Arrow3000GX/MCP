## 📊 Step 1: Check Deployment Status

### In Railway Dashboard:

1. Go to your **web service** (the one that was failing)
2. Click on **"Deployments"** tab
3. Look at the **latest deployment**:
   - 🟢 **Succeeded** - Great! Skip to Step 2
   - 🟡 **In Progress** - Wait 1-2 minutes
   - 🔴 **Failed** - Check logs

### Check the Logs

1. Click **"Logs"** tab
2. Look for these messages:

**✅ Success messages:**
```
✓ Database initialization successful
✓ Server started on port 3000
✓ Listening at http://[::]:3000
```

**❌ Error messages to watch for:**
```
✗ ECONNREFUSED - Database connection failed
✗ Port already in use
✗ Module not found
```

## 🌐 Step 2: Access Your Service

Once deployment succeeds:

### Find Your Service URL

1. In your **web service** dashboard
2. Look at the top - you'll see either:
   - A URL like: `https://desirable-bravery.railway.app`
   - Or "**unexposed**" - see Step 3

### If You See a URL:
1. Click the URL or copy it
2. Open in your browser
3. You should see the MCP Hub interface!

### If You See "unexposed":
You need to expose the service - see Step 3 below

---

## 🔓 Step 3: Expose Your Service (If Needed)

If the service shows "**unexposed**":

### Method 1: Via Settings
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Find **"Public Networking"**
3. Enable **"Generate Domain"**
4. Save

### Method 2: Via Three Dots Menu
1. Click the **"⋮"** (three dots) button at the top
2. Select **"Settings"** or **"Generate Domain"**
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**

Your service will now have a public URL!

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Your Service

### 1. Health Check
Visit:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

### 2. Main Interface
Visit:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

You should see the MCP Hub login/setup page.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment Still Failing

**Check Logs:**
1. Go to **Logs** tab
2. Look for error messages
3. Common issues:
   - Database connection still failing → Check DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Port conflicts → Check port 3000 is available
   - Module errors → Check build completed successfully

### Issue: "503 Service Unavailable"

**This is normal during initial startup!**
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Refresh the page
- Check logs to see if app is still starting

### Issue: Database Connection Error

**Verify:**
1. DATABASE_URL variable is set correctly
2. PostgreSQL service is running (green status)
3. Connection string format is correct:
   ```
   postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
   ```
